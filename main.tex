\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Begin Section

This SRS will provide an initial view into the software requirements for DealCheck, a mobile app that helps users evaluate different car deals in their hunt for a new car.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
This SRS outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the DealCheck app, detailing the system's design, features, and use cases. The intended audience includes internal stakeholders of DealCheck, such as project managers, software developers, product designers, marketing, customer support, executives, and investors. The document is written to be easily understood by all involved parties, with no prior technical expertise required.
% End SubSection

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sub:scope}

DealCheck is a mobile application that will allow users to request from the system a check on a car deal by providing any necessary data (car year, make, model, mileage, listing price, etc) and optional data (images, text description, etc.), which provides them with a rating of the car deal.
\hfill
\break

\noindent{Users are required to register an account on DealCheck to get access to all the features of the mobile application system. The users can make requests by filling out a “form” that captures all the data of a certain car to measure the fairness of the deal through the integrated experts. Furthermore, users can request recommendations for a car through the system by providing a description of their preferences (looks, engine, etc.) and requirements (price range, fuel efficiency, etc) for their car.}
\hfill
\break

\noindent{An objective of the system is to provide users with an easy and reliable way to get accurate estimates on the fairness of a car deal. Many people across the world are looking to buy a car, but are not very knowledgeable in the field. The DealCheck system acts as a guiding hand throughout the process of the user's search for their “perfect” car.}

%	\item Be consistent with similar statements in higher-level specifications (e.g., the system requirements specification), if they exist

\section{Overall Product Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}
% Begin Section

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
% Begin SubSection
DealCheck is a mobile app that will serve as a center for car pricing information. Similar to market products such as AutoTrader and CarGurus [1], DealCheck 
will offer users the ability to ensure the price of a vehicle is both accurate and fair. The application will achieve this through a variety of sources 
such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), existing databases of car price information (for example, the Kelley Blue Book)[2], and a custom algorithm 
to provide a score for the deal. Users will first login to an account, and then will be able to submit multi-modal information about the vehicle, such as 
text descriptions, images, and drop-downs. This will allow for a more in-depth analysis, considering factors such as mileage, crash history, and current 
market data. Users will also be able to view their existing reports and query history in order to access previously-searched-for information quickly. \newline

\noindent In terms of external interactions, this application will consult with an external large-language model (for example, ChatGPT) in order to source recommendations. 
Additionally, it will consult, via API, an existing database of car price records to show users historical pricing for the vehicle they are considering.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:non-functional_requirements}


%\begin{itemize}
%	\item For each non-functional requirement, provide a justification/rationale for it.\\
%	{\bf Example:} \\
%	SC1. \emph{The device should not explode in a customer’s pocket.}\\
%	{\bf Rationale:} Other companies have had issues with the batteries they used in their phones randomly exploding [insert citation]. This causes a safety issue, as the phone is often carried in a person's hand or pocket.	
%	\item If you need to make a guess because you couldn't really talk to stakeholders, you can say "We imagined stakeholders would want...because..."
%	\item Each requirement should have a unique label/number for it.
%	\item In the list below, if a particular section doesn't apply, just write N/A so we know you considered it.
%\end{itemize}

% Begin Section
\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements}
\label{sub:look_and_feel_requirements}

\subsubsection{Appearance Requirements}
\label{ssub:appearance_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-A}1.]
    \item The system shall use a neutral, professional color scheme that is not tied to any specific car brand. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} The app must maintain a consistent and professional appearance regardless of the car brand being evaluated. A neutral color scheme (e.g., soft blues, grays, and whites) helps to provide a cohesive look and ensures the focus remains on the functionality of the app, not any specific brand. This approach avoids overwhelming the user with brand-specific colors and keeps the interface easy to navigate for multiple car brands.
    
    \item The system shall have a clean, modern, and minimalistic design.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} A minimalistic approach improves usability, avoids visual clutter, and ensures the user can focus on key actions without unnecessary distractions.

    \textbf{Rationale:} Consistent fonts make the app easier to navigate and read, creating a professional and cohesive look that enhances usability. Fonts that may be good options include (Garamond, Oswald, or Open Sans) [3].

    \item  Buttons and interactive elements must be visually distinct, use uniform colors, shapes, and must have sufficient contrast with the background. \\ 
    \textbf{Rationale:} High contrast improves visibility, making it easier for users to distinguish interactive elements, such as buttons, from the rest of the interface.

    \item The system must avoid using bright or overly saturated colors as background elements on any screen.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Bright colors could be visually distracting, making it harder for users to focus on content. Neutral or soft colors will keep the interface calm and allow the user to focus on the core tasks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Style Requirements}
\label{ssub:style_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-S}1.]
    \item The system shall display a clear indicator for the user when the app is processing their input (e.g., a loading spinner, progress bar). \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This informs users that the app is actively processing their input and preparing a result. While the user won't know which expert is being consulted, they will understand that the app is working on their request.
    
    \item The system must provide the user with feedback on the final result of their car deal valuation (e.g., “Good Deal,” “Fair Deal,” “Bad Deal”).  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Regardless of which expert was consulted, the user should be presented with clear feedback about the car deal. This feedback should be easy to understand and actionable.

    \item  The system must scale and adjust its layout responsively for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} A responsive layout ensures users can interact with the app seamlessly, regardless of their device. This guarantees a consistent experience across different screen sizes and resolutions.

    \item The system should provide clear navigational cues so that the user can easily find the next step, whether that involves uploading an image, entering a textual description, or selecting from dropdowns.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Clear navigation guides users to provide the necessary input for valuation without confusion. This uniformity allows users to interact with the app fluidly, even though the backend experts may vary.

\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

% End SubSection

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\label{sub:performance_requirements}

\subsubsection{Speed and Latency Requirements}
\label{ssub:speed_and_latency_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-SL}1.]
    \item The response time of all external APIs (such as web scraping or third-party services) used in the app should not exceed 5 seconds in the worst case, with an expected response time of 2 seconds and an ideal response time of 1 second.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Given that the app fetches car deal information from external sources and processes user input, response times should ideally be under 3 seconds to ensure a seamless user experience. Delays beyond this may cause user frustration, especially when scraping external data, and could lead to abandonment if the delay exceeds 5 seconds.

    \item The system must allow users to upload car images (for AI processing) with a maximum upload time of 5 seconds.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Image uploads for AI analysis must be fast, as delays in uploading images can negatively affect the user experience. A 5 second max delay ensures that users don't feel frustrated waiting for their image to be processed.

    \item When scraping external data for similar car deals, the system should have an average response time of 3 seconds per request. The system will use asynchronous programming, prioritize essential data collection, schedule scraping during off-peak hours, and utilize rotating proxies to reduce server load. Caching frequently accessed data will minimize unnecessary requests.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Efficient web scraping is key to maintaining a smooth user experience. Limiting simultaneous requests and using asynchronous programming allows for faster, concurrent data retrieval without overloading external sources. Scheduling scraping tasks during off-peak hours optimizes resource usage, while caching and rotating proxies help reduce server strain and avoid redundant requests, ensuring quicker response times and improved efficiency [4].
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Safety-Critical Requirements}
\label{ssub:safety_critical_requirements}
N/A


\subsubsection{Precision or Accuracy Requirements}
\label{ssub:precision_or_accuracy_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-PA}1.]
    \item The app must provide car deal valuations with an accuracy rate of at least 90\% when compared to industry-standard pricing models or real-world data (Autotrader). \\ 
    \textbf{Rationale:} The car deal valuation needs to be highly accurate to build trust with users. A 90\% accuracy target ensures that users are provided with reliable assessments, which will encourage them to use the app for car deal decisions.

    \item The app must display numerical values (e.g., price, mileage, accident history) with an accuracy of up to two decimal places in the final report.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Precision in price and car details is essential for user decision-making. Displaying up to two decimal places ensures that values align with standard financial practices.

    \item The car deal valuation score (e.g., "Good Deal", "Fair Deal", "Bad Deal") must be clearly communicated with a confidence level, showing the percentage of certainty in the valuation.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Showing the level of confidence in the valuation helps users understand the reliability of the result, building trust in the app's decisions.

    \item The app must provide a prediction of the car's depreciation curve over the next 5 years based on factors like make, model, mileage, and accident history.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Depreciation prediction is crucial for car buyers to understand the long-term value of their investment. The system must consider various factors to provide an accurate estimation of the car's depreciation curve, helping users make informed decisions. The depreciation prediction should be presented with a margin of error of no more than 10\%.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reliability and Availability Requirements}
\label{ssub:reliability_and_availability_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-RA}1.]
    \item The system must have an availability of 99.9\% except when the external web scraping sources or APIs are temporarily unavailable.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} High availability is crucial for ensuring the app is always accessible for users to check car deals. A 99.9\% uptime is achievable and competitive within the industry, provided the app is not dependent on external sources that may experience downtime. 

    \item The system must create backups of all user input data and valuation results/reports and store them in a database.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Backups ensure that user-generated data and valuations are not lost in case of a system failure. This adds an additional layer of reliability and prevents loss of critical data and adheres to the ACID principles of database design.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Robustness or Fault-Tolerance Requirements}
\label{ssub:robustness_or_fault_tolerance_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-RFT}1.]
    \item The system should handle incomplete or erroneous user inputs (e.g., missing car details or invalid images) without crashing.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Even if the user provides incomplete or incorrect data, the app should not crash. Instead, it should prompt the user to correct their input or handle the error with appropriate feedback.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Capacity Requirements}
\label{ssub:capacity_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-C}1.]
    \item The system must be able to handle up to 10 simultaneous users querying car deal valuations.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Given the 3-month development timeline, it's important to focus on ensuring that the system works well with a limited number of users. Handling 10 concurrent users is a reasonable target for an initial MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and will allow you to focus on optimizing the app's core features before scaling it up.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Scalability or Extensibility Requirements}
\label{ssub:scalability_or_extensibility_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-SE}1.]
    \item The code for the system must adhere to SOLID and GRASP Design Principles and make use of appropriate GoF Design Patterns to facilitate scalability and maintainability.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Following SOLID and GRASP principles and GoF design patterns ensures that the app's code is modular, maintainable, and extensible. This makes it easier to add new features or adapt to future requirements without compromising the codebase [5].
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Longevity Requirements}
\label{ssub:longevity_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-L}1.]
    \item The system must be able to support updates for new car models (electric cars in the future), market trends, and depreciation algorithms without requiring a major redesign every year.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This ensures that the app remains relevant and up-to-date with industry changes and continues to provide accurate valuations over time.

    \item The system must be able to handle an increasing number of car models, prices, and external data points as the app grows in use, without degrading performance.  \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Over time, more car models and data points will need to be integrated into the system, and the app should be able to handle this growth without performance issues.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Innovative Features}
\label{sec:innovative_features}
The chosen innovative feature to implement is the AI-powered car recommendation system in DealCheck. This feature allows users to receive personalized vehicle suggestions based on their \textit{age, financial status, and location}. By leveraging a generative AI model, the system analyzes user input and provides car recommendations along with approximate prices. This feature enhances user convenience, making it easier for individuals to find a suitable car based on their needs. It also has the potential to increase user engagement, as personalized recommendations encourage users to explore more vehicle options. Additionally, integrating this feature with partnered dealerships can help drive business growth by connecting users with nearby dealers offering recommended cars at competitive prices. We also explored several other innovative features, which are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Request car deal comparison valuation
    \item Request depreciation curve from previous car deal reports
\end{itemize}
